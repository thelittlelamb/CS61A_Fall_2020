# CS61A_Fall_2020

* My solutions to the labs, homework, and projects. except **lab09** and **lab14** (because they are review material):

* Course: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/

* Notes is my record of the learning process and does not contain the SQL content of Chapter 1 (I forgot) and Chapter 4 (I was too lazy)

* Some suggestions:
  
  1. The reading material is very important. It is a good way to combine slides with reading materials.
  2. Recursion will be used numerous times in assignments for this course. So remember **recursive leap of faith**.
  3. The Sheme interpreter is undoubtedly a very valuable project, but it is a little difficult, providing a good learning blog that may help in completing the project

  4. I don't think the SQL part is very very important(If you're pressed for time, skip it).Because I didn't configure the interactive environment of SQL, so the lab is done very carelessly
